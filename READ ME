For my Tableau work, I decided to focus on the summer months of 2018 and 2019 as originally I wanted to see if there was any real big changes with between the years.

All sheets of my Tableau work can be referenced here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/ron7508#!/vizhome/CitiBikeAnalytics_15928887645400/Sheet1

What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
	
  From my finding, I can say with confidence that the peak times that bikes were used during the summer months were at 8am and 5-6pm. This is because it coincides with when people are usually going to work. (See Sheet 10: Peak Rider Hours in Summer)

Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?
	
  I decided for this question I would look at both 2018 and 2019 summer months. Both years yielded similar results. The top 10 stations to start a journey are as follows for 2018 (Sheet 1: Top Stations Starting 2018):
    1.	Grove St PATH
    2.	Hamilton Park
    3.	Sip Ave
    4.	Exchange Place
    5.	Newport PATH
    6.	Harborside
    7.	Marin Light Rail
    8.	Morris Canal
    9.	Warner St.
    10.	Paulus Hook

As for 2019 the top 10 stations were(Sheet 3: Top Stations Starting 2019):

    1.	Grove St PATH
    2.	Hamilton Park
    3.	Sip Ave
    4.	Harborside
    5.	Newport PATH
    6.	Marin Light Rail
    7.	Newport Pkwy
    8.	Paulus Hook
    9.	Morris Canal
    10.	City Hall
    
Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey?

	The top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey are as followed (Sheet 6 Top End Stations 2018):
    1.	Grove St PATH
    2.	Exchange Place
    3.	Hamilton Park
    4.	Newport PATH
    5.	Sip Ave
    6.	Harborside
    7.	Newport Pkwy
    8.	Marin Light Rail
    9.	City Hall
    10.	Warren St.
    
Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)

	From my findings the gender split is rather substantial on who actually use the bikes. 71% of the users are men while 21% are women, additional there is a 8% group that have not specified their gender(Sheet 8: Gender Distribution based on number of trips)

How does the average trip duration change by age
	
  Baring a few outliers, there is a steady rise between a persons age and the average duration usage of a bike. The younger the person, the longer the average trip duration. There are admittedly a few strange occurrences with average trip donation but this might be due to people miss inputting their age.
